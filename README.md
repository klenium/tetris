# Tetris in many languages

A very simple Tetris game implemented in different programming languages. It was created as a homework at an university (BMEVIAUAL00, BMEVIMIAC04), the purpose is to discover varied programming languages, tools, continuous integration, GitHub capabilities. The game is simple, but it's enough to discover a language's features, syntax and tools, compare them, try different methods, paradigms.

Each language-subproject must fulfill [the basic Tetris requirements][1].

Java was the first implementation, it's well designed to follow general object-oriented programming principles. It has [documentation][2] and [UML class diagram][3].

See `README.md` in subdirectories for additional instructions.
